# ARTI 308 – Lab 2  
## Machine Learning Problem Identification and Dataset Selection

### Problem Description
This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on their personal information and service usage data.  
This task is formulated as a **classification problem** since the target variable has two possible outcomes: churn or not churn.  
The model is expected to learn patterns from the dataset that help classify customers correctly.

### Dataset Description
The dataset used in this lab is an open-source **Customer Churn dataset** obtained from Kaggle.  
It is a tabular dataset that includes customer-related features such as demographic information and service usage details.  
The target variable in the dataset is **Churn**.
